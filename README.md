# Rent Engine — Neighborhood Explorer

Search any address and get a breakdown of what it's actually like to live there: walkability, drivability, nearby amenities, and an AI-generated neighborhood summary.

## What it does

- **Walk & Drive scores** — computed from Google Places data using density and spacing signals. Walk score rewards tight clusters of essential services within 0.5 mi. Drive score rewards spread-out amenities reachable within 10 mi (suburban signal).
- **Urban character** — a Rural → Exurban → Suburban → Urban classification based on mixed-use indicators (cafes, transit, parks) vs car-dependent infrastructure.
- **Amenities panel** — browsable grid of nearby places by category (grocery, restaurants, gyms, pharmacies, parks, transit, etc.) with walking and driving tabs.
- **Interactive map** — pins all nearby places with color-coded category markers and a filterable legend.
- **AI summary** — a short neighborhood write-up generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash, highlighting top-rated local spots.
- **Shareable links** — every search updates the URL (`?q=address`) so results can be copied and shared directly.
- **Recent searches** — last 5 searches saved locally for quick re-access.

## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router)
- [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript) — geocoding, Places nearby search, map rendering
- [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev) — neighborhood summary generation

## Setup

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

The Google Maps key needs the following APIs enabled: Maps JavaScript API, Places API, Geocoding API.

3. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
